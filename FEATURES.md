## Current Features (by Version)

### v1.0.0 — Initial Release

> Source: tag `v1.0.0` → commit `9484a11` "Add GitHub Pages landing page" (includes all commits from `d91f6de` initial commit)

- **System tray icon** — registers with `Shell_NotifyIconW`; tooltip shows `"RAMKeeper\n8.3 / 16.0 GB (52%)"`, updated every second via `WM_TIMER`
- **Manual clean — tray menu** — right-click → "Clean Now" (bold default item)
- **Manual clean — double-click** — `WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK` on tray icon triggers `DoClean()`
- **Global hotkey** — `Ctrl+Alt+R` registered with `RegisterHotKey`
- **Four-stage RAM reclaim** (`Cleaner_Run`):
  1. `EmptyWorkingSet` on every running process (user-mode trim, no admin required)
  2. `NtSetSystemInformation(MemoryFlushModifiedList)` — flushes modified page list (requires `SeProfileSingleProcessPrivilege`)
  3. `NtSetSystemInformation(MemoryPurgeStandbyList)` — purges standby list (requires same)
  4. `SetSystemFileCacheSize(-1, -1, 0)` — clears file-system cache (requires `SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege`)
- **Auto-clean engine** — four independent triggers checked every second:
  - **Threshold**: clean when RAM usage `>= thresholdPercent` (default 80 %, 5-min minimum re-clean gap)
  - **Interval**: clean every `intervalMinutes` minutes (default 30, 0 = disabled)
  - **Idle**: clean when user idle `>= onIdleMinutes` minutes (default 5, via `GetLastInputInfo`)
  - **Boot-delay**: single clean `onBootDelaySec` seconds after first launch (default 60)
- **Auto-clean toggle** — tray menu checkbox; state persisted to `config.ini` immediately
- **Balloon notification** — shows "Freed X MB (N processes trimmed)" after each clean; suppressed if `< 10 MB` freed or silent mode on
- **Config persistence** — INI file at `%APPDATA%\RAMKeeper\config.ini`; created with defaults on first run
- **Autostart** — writes/removes `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\RAMKeeper`
- **Single-instance guard** — named mutex `RAMKeeper`; second launch exits immediately
- **Tray icon resilience** — listens for `WM_TaskbarCreated` (broadcast when Explorer restarts) and re-registers the icon
- **RAM stats** — `RamStats` struct: totalBytes, availBytes, usedBytes, usedPercent, usedGB, totalGB via `GlobalMemoryStatusEx`
- **GitHub Pages site** — dark-theme landing page at `ashishpatel26.github.io/RAMKeeper`

**Default config values**

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `threshold_percent` | 80 | Clean when RAM ≥ 80 % used |
| `interval_minutes` | 30 | Force clean every 30 min |
| `on_idle_minutes` | 5 | Clean after 5 min idle |
| `on_boot_delay` | 60 | One-shot clean 60 s after start |
| `silent_mode` | false | Show balloon notifications |
| `auto_clean` | true | Auto-clean enabled |
| `start_with_windows` | false | Do not autostart by default |

---

### v1.0.1 — Settings Dialog + CI/CD + Package Manifests

> Source: tag `v1.0.1` → commit `b33f43d` "Implement Settings dialog"
> Also includes: `8a34624`/`d18552b` (GitHub Actions CI/CD), `ca02730` (winget + Chocolatey manifests)

- **Settings dialog** — Win32 modal window built programmatically (no `.rc` resource file):
  - Numeric edit fields: RAM threshold %, interval minutes, idle timeout minutes, boot delay seconds
  - Checkboxes: Auto-clean enable, Silent mode, Start with Windows
  - OK button: saves all fields to `config.ini` + updates autostart registry key
  - Cancel / ESC: discards all changes
  - Centered on screen; tab-order correct; system UI font applied to all controls
- **Settings → `DlgState` pattern** — dialog receives an `AppConfig*` pointer via `lpCreateParams`; mutations are committed only on OK (`accepted = true`)
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** — auto-build and release workflow; builds on push + publishes release assets
- **winget manifest** — `ashishpatel26.RAMKeeper` submitted for v1.0.0 and v1.0.1
- **Chocolatey package** — nuspec + install script for v1.0.1

---

### v1.0.2 — Distribution & Signing

> Source: commits `2e7f2c4`, `0fd0b18`, `82356f3`

- **ZIP release artifact** — CI now publishes both `RAMKeeper.exe` and `RAMKeeper.zip`
- **SmartScreen guidance** — README and website updated with unblock instructions
- **SignPath Foundation code signing** — attribution added; signing pipeline in progress
- **winget manifest v1.0.2** — `ashishpatel26.RAMKeeper` winget package updated
- **Chocolatey package** — nuspec + install script bumped to 1.0.2
- **GitHub Pages site** — updated with install tabs (winget/choco/manual), comparison table, config reference

---

### v1.0.3 — Settings Save Bug Fix

> Source: commits `74b11b4`, `a939b7a`

- **Fix: settings changes now persist** — root cause: `PostQuitMessage` was called inside the Settings dialog's `WM_DESTROY` path, which posted `WM_QUIT` to the main message loop and caused the entire app to exit before `Config_Save` completed. Replaced with `PostThreadMessage(WM_NULL)` to wake the nested `GetMessageW` loop without terminating the outer one. Silent regression — OK appeared to work but all changes were lost on next launch.
- **winget manifest v1.0.3** — package updated

---

### v1.1.0 — Status Window, History & Config Expansion

> Source: commit `d006bc3` "feat: v1.1.0 — status window, history, color icon, exclusions, scheduled clean"

- **Status window** — dark-mode popup (460×340) positioned above system tray:
  - Large color-coded RAM % (green/yellow/red)
  - GB usage subtitle
  - 5-minute GDI sparkline graph (area fill + line, double-buffered)
  - Recent cleans list (last 5 events: time, MB freed, process count)
  - Admin/limited mode badge (top-right)
  - Win11 dark title bar (`DWMWA_USE_IMMERSIVE_DARK_MODE`) + rounded corners (`DWMWA_WINDOW_CORNER_PREFERENCE`)
  - Closes on lose-focus or ESC
- **Status window access** — left-click tray icon toggles; tray right-click → "Status Window…"
- **RAM history ring buffer** — 300 samples (5 min at 1/sec) in `history.cpp`; feeds sparkline
- **Per-clean log** — appends UTF-8 lines to `%APPDATA%\RAMKeeper\clean.log` on every clean
- **Clean event log** — last 50 cleans in memory (`CleanEvent` ring buffer); shown in status window
- **Color-coded tray icon** — dynamically drawn 16×16 GDI icon: vertical bar fill, green < 60 % / yellow 60–80 % / red > 80 %; updated every second; previous icon destroyed on update
- **UAC detection** — checks `TokenElevation` at startup; first clean while non-elevated shows one-time balloon: "Not running as admin — standby & cache cleanup skipped"
- **Process exclusion list** — comma-separated exe names in Settings (e.g. `game.exe, vm.exe`); matching processes skipped by `EmptyWorkingSet` in `Cleaner_TrimWorkingSets`
- **Scheduled clean** — `cleanHour`/`cleanMinute` config fields (0–23 / 0–59, −1 = disabled); fires once per calendar day at the configured time via `GetLocalTime` check in `OnTimer`
- **Configurable notify threshold** — `notifyMinMB` config field (default 10); replaces hardcoded 10 MB gate in `DoClean`
- **Show status after clean** — `showStatusOnClean` config bool; opens status window automatically after each clean
- **Hotkey flash** — `Ctrl+Alt+R` in silent mode now shows a brief balloon confirming the clean fired
- **Settings dialog expanded** — new "Schedule & Notifications" section (hour, minute, notify MB, show-status checkbox) + "Process Exclusion" section (full-width text edit)
- **Binary size** — 163 KB (+14 KB from v1.0.3); no new external dependencies

**New config fields (v1.1.0)**

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `exclude_list` | *(empty)* | Comma-sep exe names to skip from WS trim |
| `clean_hour` | −1 | Scheduled clean hour (0–23), −1 = off |
| `clean_minute` | 0 | Scheduled clean minute (0–59) |
| `notify_min_mb` | 10 | Min freed MB to show balloon |
| `show_status_on_clean` | false | Open status window after each clean |

## Product Vision

> Designed thinking like a product team building a world-class OS utility — the memory manager Windows forgot to ship.

**Core thesis:** Task Manager shows the problem. Nothing fixes it intelligently. RAMKeeper becomes the proactive memory layer that makes your PC *always ready* — not just reactive.

### Three Pillars

| Pillar | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Invisible Intelligence** | Runs silently, learns patterns, cleans before you need it |
| **Radical Transparency** | When you look, you see exactly what happened, why, and what was saved |
| **Power User First** | CLI, JSON output, webhooks — developers trust it because they can control it |

### The Killer Differentiator

Every other tool cleans on a dumb threshold. RAMKeeper knows *what you're about to do* and cleans *before* you need it:

> Game launches → RAM freed → zero stutter on load
> Teams call starts → RAM freed → no lag on first screen share
> Build starts → RAM freed → compiler gets full memory

---

## Future Roadmap

> Items marked ~~strikethrough~~ shipped in v1.1.0.

### 🔜 V1.2 — "Smart Context" (next release)

- **Signed binary** — SignPath pipeline wired; removing SmartScreen friction is highest user-facing blocker
- **UAC re-launch with `runas`** — full fix is `ShellExecute` re-launch with `runas` verb; non-trivial across mutex + tray + config state
- **64-bit + ARM64 builds** — CI change only; covers Surface Pro X and Copilot+ PCs
- **CLI flags** — `RAMKeeper.exe /clean /status /exit` — scriptable from Task Scheduler, PowerShell, CI
- **Context-aware cleaning** — detect game launch (process name watch) → pre-clean before game window appears
- **Meeting Mode** — detect Teams/Zoom starting → auto-clean + silence notifications during call
- **Before/after popup** — "Freed 1.4 GB" balloon showing standby reclaimed vs working set trimmed
- **Live RAM % on tray icon** — number drawn on icon, not just color dot
- **Bigger UI** — settings + status windows resized; more breathing room, better layout

### 🗓️ V1.3 — "Power User" (2–4 weeks after V1.2)

- **JSON status output** — `RAMKeeper.exe /status --json` → pipe to scripts, dashboards, monitoring
- **Browser memory guard** — detect Chrome/Edge > 2 GB → offer working-set trim or tab-suspension prompt
- **Process watchlist** — flag top 5 memory hogs in status window with one-click trim per process
- **Webhook on clean** — HTTP POST to configured URL after each clean (Home Assistant, Zapier, Grafana)
- **Week-in-review tooltip** — tray tooltip shows "Freed 24 GB this week, 3.1 GB saved today"
- **Memory history export** — CSV/JSON export from status window; copy-to-clipboard button
- **Per-clean log viewer** — "View log…" button in status window opens `clean.log` in Notepad
- **Scheduled clean UI polish** — HH:MM time picker instead of two separate int edits

### 🚀 V2.0 — "Platform" (1–2 months)

- **Windows 11 Widget** — live RAM sparkline on desktop, one-click clean, no app open needed
- **Smart scheduling** — learn usage patterns ("you game at 9 pm, pre-clean at 8:55 pm every day")
- **Multi-machine config sync** — settings sync via GitHub Gist or OneDrive
- **RAMKeeper CLI** (`ramkeeper.exe` on PATH) — first-class terminal citizen
- **Multiple clean profiles** — "Gaming", "Work", "Build" presets with profile switcher in Settings
- **Notification customization** — toast-style (WinRT), custom sound, suppression window
- **PowerToys integration** — open PR to Microsoft PowerToys as an official module
- **Installer (MSI/NSIS)** — handles elevation, Start Menu shortcut, uninstall entry
- **Localization** — extract all `L"..."` to `.rc STRINGTABLE` for community translations

## Technical Debt & Known Gaps

| Area | Gap | Severity |
|------|-----|---------|
| **UAC re-launch** | Admin ops fail silently below elevated token; v1.1.0 surfaces balloon but does not re-launch as admin | Medium |
| **`pids[4096]` cap** | `Cleaner_TrimWorkingSets` uses fixed 4096-entry PID array; systems with > 4096 processes miss some | Low (rare) |
| **`GetLastInputInfo` 32-bit rollover** | Tick-count domain mismatch acknowledged in source; benign but could miss one idle trigger every ~49 days | Low |
| **No settings cross-validation** | `GetEditInt` clamps ranges but no cross-field checks (e.g. scheduled minute with disabled hour) | Low |
| **No uninstall cleanup** | Autostart registry key and `%APPDATA%\RAMKeeper\` not removed on uninstall (no installer yet) | Low |
| **ntdll pointer never freed** | `LoadNtdll` caches `NtSetSystemInformation` for process lifetime — correct but undocumented assumption | Informational |
| **Status window WS_EX_NOACTIVATE dance** | `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` set then cleared at creation to avoid stealing focus while still handling `WM_ACTIVATE` dismiss | Informational |
